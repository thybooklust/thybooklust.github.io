* **[Working Effectively with Legacy Code](#ISBN0131177052)** by Michael C. Feathers

  This is without question one of the essential books on my software development bookshelf. The dirty secret of software is that 80% or more if it is hacking your way through thick tangles of legacy code. This book is your survival guide in that jungle.
* **[Design Patterns](#ISBN0201633612)** by Ralph Johnson, Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, and Richard Helm

  These texts cover the design of object-oriented software and examine how to investigate requirements, create solutions and then translate designs into code, showing developers how to make practical use of the most significant recent developments. A summary of UML notation is included.
* **[Clean Code](#ISBN0132350882)** by Robert C. Martin

  How to tell the difference between good and bad code How to write good code and how to       transform bad code into good code How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes How to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic How to unit test and practice test-driven development This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.
* **[The Pragmatic Programmer](#ISBN020161622X)** by Andy Hunt, Dave Thomas

  A useful approach to software design and construction that allows for efficient, profitable development of high-quality products. Elements of the approach include specification development, customer relations, team management, design practices, development tools, and testing procedures. This approach is presented with the help of anecdotes and technical problems.
* **[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](#ISBN0262510871)** by Hal Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman

  Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs has had a dramatic impact on computer science curricula over the past decade. This long-awaited revision contains changes throughout the text. There are new implementations of most of the major programming systems in the book, including the interpreters and compilers, and the authors have incorporated many small changes that reflect their experience teaching the course at MIT since the first edition was published.
* **[The Art of Computer Programming](#ISBN0201896834)** by Donald Knuth

  This work is widely recognized as the definitive description of classical computer science. The first three volumes have for decades been an invaluable resource in programming theory and practice for students, researchers and practitioners alike. Countless readers have spoken about the profound influence of Knuth’s work. Scientists have marveled at the beauty and elegance of his analysis, while ordinary programmers have successfully applied his “cookbook” solutions to their day-to-day problems. All have admired Knuth for the breadth, clarity, accuracy, and good hum-our of his books.
* **[Coders at work](#ISBN1430219483)** by Peter Seibel

  interviews of most interesting 15 computer programmers alive today in Coders at Work, offering a companion volume to Apress’s highly acclaimed best-seller Founders at Work by Jessica Livingston. As the words “at work” suggest, Peter Seibel focuses on how his interviewees tackle the day-to-day work of programming, while revealing much more, like how they became great programmers, how they recognize programming talent in others, and what kinds of problems they find most interesting.
* **[The Mythical Man-Month](#ISBN0201835959)** by Fred Brooks

  With a blend of software engineering facts and thought-provoking opinions, Fred Brooks offers insight for anyone managing complex projects. These essays draw from his experience as project manager for the IBM System/360 computer family and then for OS/360, its massive software system. Now, 20 years after the initial publication of his book, Brooks has revisited his original ideas and added new thoughts and advice, both for readers already familiar with his work and for readers discovering it for the first time.
* **[Don't Make Me Think](#ISBN0321965515)** by Steve Krug

  about human–computer interaction and web usability. The book's premise is that a good software program or web site should let users accomplish their intended tasks as easily and directly as possible. Krug points out that people are good at satisficing, or taking the first available solution to their problem, so design should take advantage of this. He frequently cites Amazon.com as an example of a well-designed web site that manages to allow high-quality interaction, even though the web site gets bigger and more complex every day.
* **[The C Programming Language](#ISBN0131103628)** by  Brian W. Kernighan, Dennis M. Ritchie

  This book covers every concept of C language in detail. The book will be of great help to people looking to study computer concepts and C programming, computer programming, programming methodology and data structures. No concepts of C are left untouched and this book is one of the must-have sources for anyone wanting to start learning the C language or improve their present skills. This 2nd edition is published in paperback, on 1990.
